            <p>
                Food blogging is a feature of food journalism interlinking a gourmet interest in food, blog writing, and
                food photography. Food blogs are generally written by food enthusiasts often referred to as a
                “foodies” and can be used commercially by the blogger to earn a profit. The first food blog launched in
                July, 1997 as a running feature on the Chowhound web site. Titled “What Jim Had for Dinner”,
                Chowhound founder Jim Leff cataloged his daily eating.

                The majority of food blogs use pictures taken by the author himself/herself and some of them focus
                specifically on food photography.

                There are different types of Food blogging.
